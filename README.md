Introduction to Python coding

This project consisted of creating Python code to examine two different datasets, one involving election data
and one involing financial. Python is one of the leading codes called for in data analysis, and I found some
good challenge in creating code to build up dictionaries used to examine results.

PyBank reads in data from a .csv file and then uses combination of for and if looping to find the total number
of months in the dataset along with the total profits, average change in money, and both the greatest increase
and decrease in profits. The results are stored in a new .csv file as well as printed to the screen.

PyPoll also reads data in from a .csv file. This part of the project required the use of dictionaries, something
I had little experience with prior. The dictonary stores each individual candidate name as well as the number of votes
they received. It also outputs who won the election based on the total number of votes.
